mozsyncjs -- Mozilla Sync client in JavaScript
==============================================

This aims to be a complete client implementation for Mozillla's Sync
service.

Why JavaScript?
---------------

There are many platforms that allow writing applications using
JavaScript and to some extent, web technologies: Gecko, Chromium,
webOS, PhoneGap, Titanium, Gecko, etc.

Structure
---------

This project has two distinct parts:

a) Generic JavaScript Sync service and engine implementations that can
   be used across platforms.  They implement the Sync API and encapsulate
   the syncing logic.

b) Integration code for various platforms.  This abstracts things like
   HTTP requests, persisting data, crypto, etc. into an API common
   across all platforms.

Goals
-----

* async APIs wherever possible (incl. module loading)

* use JavaScript the "good parts", EcmaScript 5 idioms wherever feasible

* 100% test coverage

* fully functional on the "web" platform (assumes nothing but a modern
  web browser)

* potential other platforms: chromium, gecko, webos, phonegap, etc.
